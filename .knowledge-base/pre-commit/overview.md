## Syntax / Usage Cheatsheet

- Root config file `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: top-level `repos:` list, each entry has `repo:` (a git URL, or the `local` / `meta` sentinels), `rev:` (an immutable tag/SHA — never a branch name), and `hooks:` (list of hook ids from that repo).
- Minimal hook entry: `- id: trailing-whitespace` (uses the repo's own default `entry`/`language`); customize per-hook with `args:`, `files:` (regex to scope which paths trigger it), `language_version:`.
- `language: python` / `node` / `golang` etc. → pre-commit builds and caches an **isolated** virtualenv/toolchain for that hook, downloaded/managed entirely by pre-commit itself, independent of your project's own venv.
- `language: system` → pre-commit does _not_ create an isolated environment; it shells out to whatever's already on `PATH` (or an explicit `entry:` command) — required when a hook needs to run inside your project's own managed environment (e.g. `uv run ruff check`).
- `local` repo hooks (`repo: local`) are how you wire your own project tooling (ruff, mypy, ty) into pre-commit without publishing a separate hook repo: `- repo: local hooks: [{ id: ruff, name: ruff, entry: uv run ruff check, language: system, types: [python] }]`.
- Multi-stage hooks: a hook's `stages:` list controls which git hook type triggers it — valid stages include `pre-commit`, `pre-push`, `pre-merge-commit`, `commit-msg`, `prepare-commit-msg`, `post-commit`, `post-checkout`, and the special `manual` (only runs via `pre-commit run --hook-stage manual`, never automatically).
- Install the git hook scripts: `pre-commit install` (defaults to the `pre-commit` stage only) — to also wire pre-push/commit-msg hooks, either pass multiple `--hook-type` flags (`pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push --hook-type commit-msg`) or set `default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit, pre-push, commit-msg]` in the config so a single `pre-commit install` picks up all three.
- `default_stages:` (top-level) sets which stages a hook runs on when it doesn't declare its own `stages:` key.

## Project-Specific Gotchas

- **This repo has `.pre-commit-config.yaml` fully configured.** It sets `default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit, pre-push, commit-msg]` and uses `language: system` for project tools (`ruff`, `ty`, `mypy`, `eslint`, `tsc`, `prettier`, `pytest`, `vitest`). It also includes a custom script hook `reject-ai-attribution` (`scripts/check-claude-attribution.sh`) to reject `Co-Authored-By` trailers referencing AI.
- `pytest` (backend) and `vitest` (frontend) test suites with 90% coverage enforcement run on the `pre-push` stage, while fast linter and type check passes run on `pre-commit`.
- **commit-msg stage** is where commitizen's Conventional Commits format check belongs (see commitizen leaf) — remember `commit-msg` hooks need `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg` (or the `default_install_hook_types` config) run at least once per clone, or the hook silently never fires even though it's correctly defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- Mixing `language: system` hooks with pre-commit's normal isolated-env hooks (e.g. a standard `pre-commit-hooks` repo hook for `trailing-whitespace`) in the same config is fine and common — just don't assume a `system` hook's tool version is pinned by pre-commit's cache the way an isolated-env hook's `rev:`/`additional_dependencies:` would pin it; a `system` hook's actual version is whatever `uv sync`/`npm ci` currently has installed.
- **Any auto-fixing hook (`prettier --write`, `ruff format`, `ruff check --fix`) fails the commit on the first attempt if it had to change something** — the hook exits non-zero to signal "I modified files," even though the fix itself succeeded, and the modified file is left unstaged. `git commit` then reports the hook as `Failed`. The fix is not to investigate a bug: re-run `git add <file>` to stage the hook's own changes, then `git commit` again — it passes clean the second time since there's nothing left to fix. Docs-only commits touching `.md` files hit this via `prettier --write (markdown, one line per paragraph)`; Python changes hit the equivalent via `ruff format`/`ruff check --fix`.

## Minimal Example

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit, commit-msg]

repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: ruff-check
        name: ruff check
        entry: uv run --project backend ruff check --fix
        language: system
        types: [python]
      - id: ty-check
        name: ty check
        entry: uv run --project backend ty check
        language: system
        types: [python]
        pass_filenames: false
  - repo: https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen
    rev: v4.9.1
    hooks:
      - id: commitizen
        stages: [commit-msg]
```
